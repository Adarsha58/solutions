Ad-hoc sorting problem. Took ages to get right.

Convert ["higher", "middle", "lower"] to [3, 2, 1] in each array of classes inputted. Reverse each person's list of numbers to get the order of precedence right. Then right-pad this list with 2s so all names have the same length of classes. Stable-sort these first by name, and then backwards by this class array.

Runs in 0.3s in python3.
