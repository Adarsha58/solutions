Important to note that despite the problem statement wording, this is not a graph problem; the numbers are much too large. It is a number theory problem. The answer is `min(N, 1 + k + N - k\*int(N/k))`, where `N` = `n-1`. That is, either the shortest way to the given number `N` is to step through every number up to `N`, or it is to step up to the lowest multiple of `k`, jump to the highest multiple of `k` that is below or equal to `N`, and then step through every remaining number until `N`.
