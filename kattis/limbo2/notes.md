An annoying number theory ish problem. Drawing out the grid helps a lot. You just need to do some base-2 stuff to figure out at which level the given coordinates will be added in, and then figure out the exact value at those points.
A lot of off-by-ones (and off-by-twos) involved. Runs in 0.02s in python3.
