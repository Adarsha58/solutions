It is sufficient to do a breadth first search (with a priority queue), minimising the number of steps across languages, and secondarily minimising cost, keeping a global table of these values, and never entering a node if the number of steps it has taken you > the number of steps it took you before, or if the number of steps is equal, if the cost it took you is higher than the cost before.
