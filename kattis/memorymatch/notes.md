An ad-hoc problem.

It is trivial to match cards where both locations of the same card is known.
If for every other card type, you know where one of the pair is, it is possible to solve every card by turning over one of the unknown locations and matching it with wherever its known match is.
Otherwise, if there are only 2 cards left, they must match.
