A geometry problem. Can be solved with a priority queue, keyed with the area of each triangle (and secondary key = the index of the middle point of the triangle). I did the comparisons in reverse here so the priority queue would have smallest entry first, instead of largest as is normal. I could have made it easier by using the triangle area times 2, and avoided floating point comparisons and conversions. Runs in 0.1s in C++.
