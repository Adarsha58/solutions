Iterate through the numbers, summing each one and every other number you have ever seen before (a set called `seen`), and making this your new `seen` set. However, this will run out of time. But you can throw away any numbers that are obviously too large and will not get you any closer to your goal of `1000`. This solution runs in 0.05s in python2, and 0.25s in python3.
