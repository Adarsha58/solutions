A classic problem. Use the shunting yard algorithm to convert brackets notation to RPN. ie:

1. If you come across a variable, print it immediately.
2. If you come across an operation, add it to the stack.
3. If you come across a closing bracket, print the operation at the top of the stack.

Runs in 0.00s in C++.
