A stack problem. Whenever you come across an opening bracket while iterating the sequence, add it to the stack. Whenever you come across a closing bracket, check the top of the stack, and if it matches, continue on to the next bracket in the sequence. If it does not match, or if there is nothing in the stack, or if the stack still contains items after the sequence has been iterated, then the sequence is not valid.
